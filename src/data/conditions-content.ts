    subtitle: "Structured Recovery for Chronic and Recurring Back Pain — Refined Over 45 Years",
    intro: "Back pain often improves temporarily — but returns when underlying issues remain. If you've been living with it for weeks, months, or years, you may already have tried rest, medication, or other treatments without lasting improvement.\n\nAt YAPCHANKOR, we regularly see patients in this situation — where the pain persists despite multiple attempts to treat it.",
    whyNotImprove: "Back pain is rarely caused by a single issue. In many cases, it involves a combination of structural stress in the spine, movement limitations, and persistent inflammation. Treatments that focus on only one aspect — such as pain relief alone or exercise alone — may not fully resolve the condition. This is why many patients experience temporary relief, only for the pain to return.",
    whatCauses: [
      "Muscle and ligament strain from injury or overuse",
      "Slipped or herniated discs",

      "Osteoporosis-related compression fractures",

    approach: "Our approach is shaped by Shaolin injury medicine — a tradition developed through treating real musculoskeletal injuries — and refined through over 45 years of clinical experience.

Worn for at least 12 hours, the patches work to reduce inflammation, improve circulation and support the body's natural recovery process.",
    step3: "As your condition improves, we guide you through targeted exercises to strengthen your back, correct your posture and maintain the gains you've made — so the pain doesn't return.",
    expectation: "Many patients begin to notice improvement within the first few sessions. Recovery depends on the severity and duration of your condition and your consistency with recommended exercises. Our focus is on sustainable recovery — not short-term relief.",

    intro: "You may find it difficult to sleep on your side, lift your arm, or carry out simple daily tasks. Frozen shoulder doesn't just limit movement — it gradually affects everyday life. If you've been told to wait it out, you may already know how frustrating that can be. Without proper management, the full cycle of frozen shoulder — from freezing to frozen to thawing — can take months or even years.",
    whyNotImprove: "Frozen shoulder — medically known as adhesive capsulitis — develops in stages, each lasting several months. The joint capsule gradually tightens, restricting movement and causing persistent inflammation. In many cases, treatment focuses on either reducing pain or improving mobility — but not both together. Without addressing inflammation while restoring movement at the same time, recovery may plateau rather than progress.",

If you have existing X-rays, MRIs or CT scans, bring them along.",
    step2: "Your treatment plan combines hands-on physiotherapy — including muscle release, heat therapy, TENS electrical stimulation and ultrasound — to relax the shoulder joint and surrounding soft tissues. Following each session, our proprietary herbal patches are applied directly around the affected shoulder joint and worn for at least 12 hours to reduce inflammation, improve circulation and support recovery.",
    step3: "As your shoulder loosens, we guide you through progressive range of motion exercises to restore full function. Consistency with these exercises between sessions is key to maintaining and building on the improvements made in clinic.",
    expectation: "Frozen shoulder develops gradually over time — and recovery also takes time. Many of our patients report noticeable progress around the 7th session.

The shoulder is one of the most complex joints in the body, which is why pain here can be difficult to resolve without the right approach.",
    whyNotImprove: "Shoulder pain can originate from the joint itself, or from the surrounding muscles, tendons, ligaments and soft tissues. Because so many structures are involved, a problem in one area often creates compensatory strain in others — which is why the pain can persist, spread, or worsen over time.

Many patients also notice stiffness when getting up from a seated position, or reduced flexibility when moving the hip.",
    whyNotImprove: "Hip osteoarthritis is not just a wear-and-tear issue. It often involves a combination of cartilage degeneration within the hip joint, inflammation contributing to pain and stiffness, reduced range of motion and joint mobility, and weakening of surrounding muscles due to reduced use.
